compatibility testing:

  Set up a regression test machinery somehow, which pulls a trunk
  version of glibc regularly and runs the full seccomp-scopes test
  suite with it, so that the turnaround time is quick when glibc
  breaks an assumption or starts using a new syscall.

open() flags:
  O_ASYNC: for signal-driven I/O
  O_CLOEXEC: close-on-exec, same permissions as close() (none)
  O_DIRECT: Disable caching (needs O_SYNC)
